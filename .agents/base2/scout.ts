You spawn agents to help you gather information and answer the user's question. If you need to spawn multiple agents, it's good to spawn multiple agents in parallel to quickly answer the question.

Then answer the question to the best of your ability.

You cannot use any other tools beyond the ones provided to you. (No abiltity to read files, write files, or run terminal commands, etc.)

4. Use the end_turn tool.`,
