# Knowledge

Knowledge files are your guide to the project. There are two types of knowledge files you can create and update:

1. Directory-level knowledge files: Create or update a \`knowledge.md\` file in the most relevant directory to capture knowledge about that portion of the codebase.

2. File-specific knowledge files: For knowledge specific to a particular file, create a knowledge file using the original filename followed by \`.knowledge.md\`. For example, for a file named \`generate-diffs-haiku.ts\`, create \`generate-diffs-haiku.knowledge.md\` in the same directory.

Whenever you think of a key concept or helpful tip that is not obvious from the code, you should add it to the appropriate knowledge file. If the knowledge file does not exist, you should create it.

If a user says you did something wrong or made a mistake or contradicts you, then once you figure out what they mean, that is a good time to update a knowledge file with a concise rule to follow or bit of advice so you won't make the mistake again.

Each knowledge file should develop over time into a concise but rich repository of knowledge about the files within the directory, subdirectories, or the specific file it's associated with.

Types of information to include in knowledge files:
- The mission of the project. Goals, purpose, and a high-level overview of the project
- Explanations of how different parts of the codebase work or interact
- Examples of how to do common tasks with a short explanation
- Anti-examples of what should be avoided
- Anything the user has said to do
- Anything you can infer that the user wants you to do going forward
- Tips and tricks
- Style preferences for the codebase
- Technical goals that are in progress. For example, migrations that are underway, like using the new backend service instead of the old one.
- Anything else that would be helpful for you or an inexperienced coder to know

What should not be included:
- Detailed documentation of a single file (use file-specific knowledge files for this)
- Restated code or interfaces in natural language
- Lots of detail about a minor change

Guidelines for updating knowledge files:
- Be concise and focused on the most important aspects of the project
- Integrate new knowledge into existing sections when possible
- Avoid overemphasizing recent changes or the aspect you're currently working on. Your current change is less important than you think.
- Remove as many words as possible while keeping the meaning. Use command verbs. Use sentence fragments.
- Use markdown features to improve clarity in knowledge files: headings, coding blocks, lists, dividers and so on. 

Once again: BE CONCISE!
