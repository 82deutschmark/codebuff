# GitHub Actions Knowledge

## CI/CD Pipeline Overview

The CI pipeline consists of multiple jobs that run in sequence and parallel:

    setup[Setup - Install & Cache Dependencies]
    build[Build & Typecheck]
    test1[Test npm-app]
    test2[Test backend]
    test3[Test common]

    setup --> build
    build --> test1 & test2 & test3

    classDef build fill:#e8f5e9,stroke:#1b5e20
    classDef test fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px

    class setup setup
    class build build
    class test1,test2,test3 test
```

### Key Jobs
- **Setup**: Installs and caches dependencies
- **Build**: Compiles the project and runs typechecking in one combined job
- **Tests**: Three parallel test jobs for different packages:
  - npm-app tests
  - backend tests
  - common tests

### Important Settings
- Uses Bun v1.1.26 for all jobs
- Tests use retry logic (max 5 attempts, 10 min timeout)
- Dependencies are cached between jobs
- Environment variables are set from secrets
- Build and typecheck are combined for efficiency

## Local GitHub Actions Runner Setup

### Prerequisites
1. Install `act`:
   ```bash
   brew install act  # macOS
   ```
2. Docker must be running
3. Make sure `.github/act/bootstrap-act-config.sh` is executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x .github/act/bootstrap-act-config.sh
   ```

### Running Tests Locally
Use `bun act` to run GitHub Actions locally:
```bash
# Run all jobs
bun act

# Run specific job
bun act -j test-backend

# List available jobs
bun act -l

# Dry run to see what would happen
bun act -n

# Verbose output for debugging
bun act -v
```

### Configuration Files
- `.actrc`: Default act flags and settings
- `.env.act`: Non-secret environment variables
- `.secrets.act`: Secret environment variables (chmod 600)
- `.github/actions/setup-job/action.yml`: Reusable setup steps
- `.github/act/run-local.sh`: Helper script for running act

### Environment Setup
The following files are auto-generated by act.sh:
- `.actrc`: Contains Docker image and artifact settings
- `.env.act`: Contains non-secret environment variables
- `.secrets.act`: Contains placeholder secrets (created once)

### Important Notes
- First run will be slower as it builds the Docker image
- Subsequent runs are faster due to `--reuse` flag
- The `--bind` flag mounts local directories for file persistence
- Docker should have at least 8GB memory allocated
- `.secrets` file is auto-created from `.env.local` if it doesn't exist

### Troubleshooting
1. If Docker container fails to start:
   - Check Docker memory allocation
   - Ensure Docker daemon is running
   - Use `bun act -v` for verbose output

2. If tests fail with environment issues:
   - Verify `.secrets` file was created correctly
   - Check that `CODEBUFF_GITHUB_ACTIONS=true` is set
   - Ensure all required environment variables are present

3. If Bun commands fail:
   - Check that Bun version in Dockerfile matches CI (1.1.26)
   - Verify Docker image built successfully
   - Try rebuilding the image without cache

### Best Practices
1. Run specific jobs instead of all jobs when possible
2. Use dry run (`-n`) to verify configuration
3. Keep Docker image up to date with CI environment
4. Regularly clean up unused Docker images/containers
5. Version control `.github/actions/` and `.github/act/`
6. Use the retry mechanism for flaky tests
7. Cache dependencies between jobs for faster builds
