# What models do you use?

We primarily use Claude Sonnet for the coding, Gemini Flash to find relevant files.

Codebuff also uses [Relace AI](https://www.relace.ai/) for fast file rewrites.

We have two modes, which slightly changes the above set-up, mainly to achieve higher performance (in `max`) or lower cost (in `lite`):

- `--max`: uses Claude Sonnet and also pulls more files on your codebase to better handle complex problems.
- `--lite`: uses Claude Haiku for editing instead of Sonnet (~1/3 the cost). It also pulls fewer files, meaning that the context cost will be much smaller.
