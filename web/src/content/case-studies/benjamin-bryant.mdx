# Supercharging Benjamin Bryant's Coding Workflow

Benjamin Bryant runs an investment fund that invests in YC companies. He has been coding since he was young, and has had programming gigs since middle school. At the fund, he built most of the internal tooling.

In his day to day, he switches between different roles rapidly, going from development, business pitches, and sales in the course of a day. Each feature often took at least an afternoon, sometimes even days.

## Enter Codebuff 
Codebuff helped him reduce the time down two minutes, if not hours.

> In 10 minutes, Codebuff will get me most of the way there... It's like having an extension of your brain.

Better yet, Codebuff lets Ben take on more ambitious projects. The tool saves him time, but it also means that he can do more iterations and build larger projects.

For example, he needed to build a system to generate tear sheets for our portfolio companies. Previously, he said that he might have pushed it off or cobbled together a manual workaround – the classic "I'll build it properly later" that never happens. Instead, he just described what he wanted to Codebuff, and within minutes it had scaffolded out the PDF generation, API integrations, and data models. He still had to tweak things here and there, but the heavy lifting was done.

Codebuff didn't just spit out generic code – it matched their patterns, formatting, even their quirky architectural decisions. It's like having a really sharp junior dev who perfectly gets your coding style.

For someone who's been coding forever but can't dedicate solid blocks of time to it anymore, this tool is a game-changer. It's not about replacing developers – it's about making experienced devs more effective.
