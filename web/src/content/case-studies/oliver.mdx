# Codebuff as an Engineer

Oliver is building a platform to help European companies streamline their grant application process. He faced a familiar challenge: maintaining development velocity while ensuring code quality.

At first, Oliver various other tools: GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and others. While they generated code, they often failed to work with his existing libraries and ignored his project's specific requirements. Refactors also required a lot of time and effort, and he wanted to outsource them to focus on the actual business.

Oliver had a straightforward challenge for all the tools that he tried: implement a complete feature, including the endpoint and supporting code. Most tools responded with boilerplate that ignored his project's specific needs or, worse, produced entirely irrelevant code. 

But when he tried Codebuff, something clicked. The tool not only understood his codebase structure but also respected his established patterns and libraries. Even when it wasn't perfect, the fixes were minor—usually just adding a missing import or tweaking the structure slightly.

What set Codebuff apart wasn't just its accuracy. Oliver appreciated its lightweight approach—he could use it as needed without feeling locked into a specific workflow. This flexibility proved crucial as his development process evolved.

To maximize the tool's effectiveness, Oliver started maintaining a ```knowledge.md``` file containing architectural details and coding standards. This became a living document, updated whenever Codebuff faced a challenge, creating a feedback loop that improved results over time. When particularly complex features arose—like certain nested Superbase queries—Oliver would handle those himself while letting Codebuff handle the rest.

The results spoke for themselves. Oliver found himself spending less time on routine coding tasks and more on strategic planning. With Codebuff's assistance, maintaining clean, adaptable code became less daunting. When another developer joined the team, Oliver introduced them to Codebuff, confident in its ability to maintain consistent coding standards across the project.

For Oliver's startup, finding the right AI coding assistant wasn't just about automating tasks—it was about finding a tool that could truly understand and adapt to his project's needs. Codebuff allows him to focus on the important stuff and handle the rest. In the fast-paced world of startup development, that kind of reliability proves invaluable.
